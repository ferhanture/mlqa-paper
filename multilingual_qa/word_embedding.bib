	Abstract = {The supremacy of n-gram models in statistical language modelling has recently been challenged by parametric models that use distributed representations to counteract the difficulties caused by data sparsity. We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models.},

@inproceedings{Bai:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In this article we propose Supervised Semantic Indexing (SSI), an algorithm that is trained on (query, document) pairs of text documents to predict the quality of their match. Like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), our models take account of correlations between words (synonymy, polysemy). However, unlike LSI our models are trained with a supervised signal directly on the ranking task of interest, which we argue is the reason for our superior results. As the query and target texts are modeled separately, our approach is easily generalized to different retrieval tasks, such as online advertising placement. Dealing with models on all pairs of words features is computationally challenging. We propose several improvements to our basic model for addressing this issue, including low rank (but diagonal preserving) representations, and correlated feature hashing (CFH). We provide an empirical study of all these methods on retrieval tasks based on Wikipedia documents as well as an Internet advertisement task. We obtain state-of-the-art performance while providing realistically scalable methods.},

@other{He:2014aa,
	Abstract = {<p>Deep learning techniques have demonstrated tremendous success in the speech
                and language processing community in recent years, establishing new
                state-of-the-art performance in speech recognition, language modeling, and have
                shown great potential for many other natural language processing tasks. The focus
                of this tutorial is to provide an extensive overview on recent deep learning
                approaches to problems in language or text processing, with particular emphasis
                on important real-world applications including spoken language understanding,
                semantic representation modeling, information retrieval, semantic parsing and
                question answering, etc.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will first survey the latest
                deep learning technology, presenting both theoretical and practical perspectives
                that are most relevant to our topic. We plan to cover common methods of deep
                neural networks and more advanced methods of recurrent, recursive, stacking, and
                convolutional networks. In addition, we will introduce recently proposed
                continuous-space representations for both semantic word embedding and knowledge
                base embedding, which are modeled by either matrix/tensor decomposition or neural
                networks.</p>
<p>Next, we will review general problems and tasks in text/language
                processing, and underline the distinct properties that differentiate language
                processing from other tasks such as speech and image object recognition. More
                importantly, we highlight the general issues of language processing, and
                elaborate on how new deep learning technologies are proposed and fundamentally
                address these issues. We then place particular emphasis on several important
                applications:1) spoken language understanding, 2) semantic information retrieval,
                3) semantic parsing and question answering. For each task, we discuss what
                particular architectures of deep learning models are suitable given the nature of
                the task, and how learning can be performed efficiently and effectively using
                end-to-end optimization strategies.</p>
<p>Besides providing a systematic
                tutorial of the general theory, we will also present hands-on experience in
                building state-of-the-art SLU/IR/QA systems. In the tutorial, we will share our
                practice with concrete examples drawn from our first-hand experience in major
                research benchmarks and some industrial scale applications which we have been
                working on extensively in recent years.</p>},
